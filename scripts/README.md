# Codex
Codex is an open-source ecosystem enabling the curation of specialized
datasets, or corpuses, for source code authorship attribution (SCAP). This
ecosystem especially thrives on obtaining and digesting source code submissions
from competitive programming platforms such as Google Code Jam (GCJ), Leet
Code, and Codeforces. Specifically, these competitive programming platforms
oftentimes archive millions, or billions, of submissions, which can be viewed
publicly. Codex strives to provide developers with an intuative interface for
analyzing and managing large collections of subbimissions, reducing frustration
while bolstering productivity.

The ecosystem provides the aforementioned features by modularizing the
inherently multi-facited problem of corpus curation. Specifically, the workflow
has been divided into three stages: indexing, refinement, and deployment. This
approach, greatly reduces the volume of a singular, monolithic codebase towards
a dynamic ecosystem optimized hyper-optimized for specific problems.

The first stage, indexing occures when Codex populates a database with submission
metadata, especially the author, unique identifier, submission time, etc. The
second stage, refinement, is the most critical part of the process, involving
filtering out poor-quality submissions to increase the overall quality of the
dataset. The final step, deployment, involves using the filtered collection
of submission metadata to systematically "scrape" those given submissions.
